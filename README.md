# PackAdvisor

*Originally developed for the* ***Record Hacks*** *Spring 2025 hackathon, run by Freetail Hackers and held at the University of Texas at Austin.*

PackAdvisor is an app designed to help people gather adequate supplies for evacuation in an emergency.

### Why Use PackAdvisor?

Disaster supply kits (sometimes also known as bug-out bags, go bags, etc.) contain all the essential supplies necessary for surviving through natural disasters; governments and agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), provide official guidelines for assembling kits for a variety of situations. However, people who have not taken these steps beforehand may be caught unprepared during an emergency, and may not have proper time to research detailed lists of adequate supplies to take.

PackAdvisor aims to solve this issue by providing a quick interface for specifying your emergency and situation, and generating a list of supplies programatically tailored to your needs. Supply lists are pre-planned and based on current prevailing recommendations from FEMA and other organizations, so you know that the information you receive is reliable and well-researched. The list automatically adjusts itself depending on your time constraints and carrying capacity. As such, the app is easy and intuitive to use, even in a stressful emergency situation where users may be unable to think clearly.

In addition to the core feature of immediate emergency planning, PackAdvisor also allows for long-term, non-urgent planning, to help users build comprehensive disaster supply kits in accordance with official recommendations. PackAdvisor also contains educational features aimed at children aged 8-13, which can be used independently or in the classroom to raise disaster awareness and prepare families for emergency situations.

### Use Cases

PackAdvisor is designed for multiple common emergency situations, including:
- Hurricanes
- Floods
- Wildfires
- Winter Storms
- Earthquakes
- Tornados

PackAdvisor also adjusts supplies for users with families including pets and/or children.

Both the non-urgent planning and education modes contain more detailed information on all of these disaster situations as well.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project. -->
