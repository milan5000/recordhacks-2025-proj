# PackAdvisor

Repository for our project for the Record Hacks hackathon at UT Austin.

PackAdvisor is an app designed to help people gather adequate supplies for evacuation in an emergency.

Disaster supplies kits (sometimes also known as bug-out bags, go bags, etc.) contain all the essential supplies necessary for surviving through natural disasters; governments and agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), provide official guidelines for assembling kits for a variety of situations. However, people who have not taken these steps beforehand may be caught unprepared during an emergency, and may not have proper time to research detailed lists of adequate supplies to take.

PackAdvisor aims to solve this issue by providing a quick TODO FINISH
